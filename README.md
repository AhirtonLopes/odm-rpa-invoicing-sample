### Create a Credential vault in IBM RPA Control Room

## Scenario

Jack is an accountant for Acme Retail, a small retailing company.

Andrea is a reseller for Acme Retail. Each week, she orders a list of goods to Jack, sending him 
<a target="_blank" href="./assets/invoices.csv">a CSV file </a>
listing the quantity and unit price of each item she wants to order.

Jack uses invoicely.com to register invoices corresponding to Andreas orders. 

Depending on the quantity and type of goods, he applies a tax rate and a discount to each row in the orders CSV
and save the result in his invoicely account.

## Automating invoice creation with IBM RPA

### Creating the Invoice

The [Create Invoice](./assets/Create%20Invoice.atmx) script creates an invoice in Invoicely, given
a unit price, a quantity, an order id and an item description.

1. Login, create Invoice, set order ID, description and quantity

    ![Create Invoice 1](./screenshots/CreateInvoice_01.png)

2. Set tax and unit price

    ![Create Invoice 1](./screenshots/CreateInvoice_02.png)

3. Set client information, save and logout

    ![Create Invoice 1](./screenshots/CreateInvoice_03.png)

### Read the CSV

Since neither the tax nor the discount are part of the CSV, we ask them to the user through a prompt dialog
